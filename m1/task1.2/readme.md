Hi!

DevOps is a separate methodology, possibly culture.
I think that DevOps it's synergy at development and operations.
DevOps includes the main aspects of different areas of IT - testing, the concept of networks, programming, system administration, etc.
This is a very promising area, which in the future will be widely distributed with certain changes.
I like it !
